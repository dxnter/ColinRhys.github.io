          <p class="mb-5">I am passionate about finance; when I was nine years old my mother explained to me why she would prefer buying me a happy meal at Taco Bell over McDonald's jokingly saying, “Since I own stock in Taco Bell but not in McDonalds, I make a little bit of money from everyone going to Taco Bell.” It was at this point that my love of the stock market and investing began. When I was fourteen I made my first trade, making one hundred dollars and after that there was no looking back.</p>

              <p>Before I began at the Coding Dojo I had heard of Raspberry Pi's and thought they were super cool. I initially wanted to make an old fashion scrolling stock ticker with led lights. Once I started researching the project I found that it would be cheaper to buy the official touch screen made by the Raspberry Pi foundation. I also found the Magic Mirror project <a target="_blank" href="https://magicmirror.builders/">(Click Here For Website)</a> and though I could use it as a base to make more than just a simple scrolling stock ticker. I wanted to reformat the display to be more of an information dashboard rather than a mirror. This presented a bit of a challenge because the default formating was not a dashboard like setting. I overcame this challenge by creating my own CSS class that used the full screen. With this new class in place I was able to fit the scrolling stock ticker I originally wanted and a lot of other cool modules on my display. All of the modules use their own APIs for the data that is being fed into and displayed on the screen.</p>
              <br>
              <p>The module for the stock ticker at the bottom of the screen initially showed the 0's of unchanged stocks as red. I thought it would be better to have them be grey a neutral color and different than the white of the stock ticker symbols. I added an if check for the stock change being zero and created a new CSS class for unchanged stocks that makes the 0 grey.After changing the code and making sure it worked I opened a pull request on gitHub so everyone else could have grey zeros.</p>

          <p>Apart from finance and developing software , I enjoy reading. I read the Economist every week and always look forward to Saturdays, knowing I can wake up go to the gym, then come back and read the hard copy of the Economist with some coffee.</p>
          <p class="mb-0">In addition to the Economist I generally have more than one book going at a time.  I bounce between them; if I  find myself getting tired of one I go to another and then come back to the one I started, and so forth.. I enjoy nonfiction, especially biographies.</p>
          <br>
          <p>After receiving my degree in Economics from the University of Tampa I chose to move to Chicago -- a great city with a larger financial job market. I have not regretted it one bit! One of my favorite things about Chicago is the great selection of live Jazz music.</p>
